    Thus spake the master programmer:

     "Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to
     be maintained."

  A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.
  A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.
  Neither sound nor thoughts can travel through a vacuum.
  Software rots if not used.

  These are great mysteries.

  A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish
  the program on which he was working. "I will be finished tomorrow,"
  the programmer promptly replied.

  "I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager, "Truthfully,
  how long will it take?"

  The programmer thought for a moment. "I have some features that I
  wish to add. This will take at least two weeks," he finally said.

  "Even that is too much to expect," insisted the manager, "I will be
  satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete."

  The programmer agreed to this.

  Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his
  retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his
  terminal. He had been programming all night.

  A novice programmer was once assigned to code simple financial
  package.

  The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master
  reviewed his program, he discovered that it contained a screen
  editor, a set of generalized graphics routines, an artificial
  intelligence interface, but not the slightest mention of anything
  financial.

  When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant.
  "Don't be so impatient," he said, " I'll put in the financial stuff
  eventually."

  Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?
  Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?
  Does a good father allow a single child to starve?
  Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code?
