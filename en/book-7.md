    Thus spake the master programmer:

     "You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but
      you can't make him computer literate."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    7.1

  A novice asked the master: "In the east there is a great tree-
  structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated
  out of shape with vice presidents and accountants.  It issues a
  multitude of memos, each saying 'Go, Hence!' or 'Go, Hither!' and
  nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the
  branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity
  exist?"

  The master replies: "You perceive this immense structure and are
  disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take
  amusement from its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the
  untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches?
  Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"

  In the east there is a shark which is larger than all other fish.
  It changes into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky.
  When this bird moves across the land, it brings a message from
  Corporate Headquarters. This message it drops into the midst of the
  programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach. Then the
  bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns
  home.

  The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he
  understands it not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the
  bird, for he fears its message. The master programmer continues to
  work at his terminal, for he does not know that the bird has come
  and gone.

    7.3

  The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for
  the master programmer to examine. The magician wheeled a large
  black box into the master's office while the master waited in
  silence.

  "This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,"
  began the magician, "ergonomically designed with a proprietary
  operating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of
  the art user interfaces. It took my assistants several hundred man
  years to construct. Is it not amazing."

  The master raised his eyebrows slightly. "It is indeed amazing," he
  said.

  "Corporate Headquarters has commanded," continued the magician,
  "that everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.
  Do you agree to this?"

  "Certainly," replied the master, " I will have it transported to the
  data center immediately!" And the magician returned to his tower,
  well pleased.

  Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master
  programmer and said, "I cannot find the listing for my new program.
  Do you know where it might be?"

  "Yes," replied the master, "the listings are stacked on the platform
  in the data center."

    7.4

  The master programmer moves form program to program without fear.
  No change in management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if
  the project is cancelled. Why is this? He is filled with Tao.
