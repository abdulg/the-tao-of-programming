    Thus spake the master programmer:

     "A well-written program is its own heaven; a poorly-written
     program is its own hell."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    4.1

  A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a
  string of pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be
  retained throughout. There should be neither too little or too much,
  neither needless loops nor useless variables, neither lack of
  structure nor overwhelming rigidity.

  A program should follow the 'Law of Least Astonishment'. What is this
  law? It is simply that the program should always respond to the user
  in the way that astonishes him least.

  A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The
  program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward
  appearances.

  If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
  disorder and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite
  the program.

    4.2

  A novice asked the master: "I have a program that sometime runs and
  sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am
  totally baffled. What is the reason for this?"

  The master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand
  Tao. Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.
  Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?
  Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is prefect.

  The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal.
  Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment."

  "But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?" asked the
  novice.

  "Your program will then run correctly," replied the master.

    4.3

  A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices,
  "The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how
  insignificant," said the master.

  "Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?" asked the novice.

  "It is," came the reply.

  "Is the Tao in a video game?" continued the novice.

  "It is even in a video game," said the master.

  "And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?"

  The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. "The lesson
  is over for today," he said.

    4.4

  Prince Wang's programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon
  the keyboard. The program compiled without an error message, and the
  program ran like a gentle wind.

  "Excellent!" the Prince exclaimed, "Your technique is faultless!"

  "Technique?" said the programmer turning from his terminal, "What I
  follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program
  I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three
  years I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now
  I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses
  are idle.  My spirit, free to work without plan, follows its own
  instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there
  are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch
  silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties
  vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit
  still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for
  a moment and then log off."

  Prince Wang said, "Would that all of my programmers were as wise!"
